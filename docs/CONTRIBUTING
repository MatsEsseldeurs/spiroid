## Style

### Variable and function naming
- Every variable and function should be descriptively named, and must be in English.
- Uppercase letters must not be used in variable names.
- Variables must begin with a letter.
- Single letter variables are acceptable only in small scopes where the context is apparent (for example inside a loop).
- Greek letter names (such as `alpha`, `sigma`) are acceptable only inside functions of a formula implementation if their full descriptive name is too long. In this case, a comment must exist providing a description of what the variable represents.

### Numerical constants
- All numerical constants representing a physical quantity must be defined as an `UPPERCASE_CONSTANT`, including a reference to the source of the value.
- Literal numerical values (e.g. `780.457`) are are acceptable only inside functions of a formula implementation. In this case, a comment must exist providing a brief description of what the number represents.

## Documentation

### Functions
- All physics functions must include a comment specifying the source of the equation, including equation number (if applicable).
- The source should be a simple reference, typically the canonical author name and year (e.g. "Planetman, 2001"). A full reference including the DOI must exist in the references section.

### References
- Add a DOI [Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) link to each reference into the `References` section, at the end of each module (source file). Keep this reference section sorted alphabetically.
